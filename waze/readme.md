# Waze Data Analysis Project

### Background
Waze is a GPS navigation software app that provides turn-by-turn navigation information and user-submitted travel times and route details, while simultaneously downloading location-dependent information over a mobile telephone network. With millions of active users worldwide, Waze gathers and analyzes a vast amount of traffic and driving data. This data can be invaluable in understanding driving behaviors, improving navigation algorithms, and enhancing user experience. As part of a larger effort to leverage big data for smarter transportation systems, analyzing Waze data helps in uncovering patterns and insights that contribute to more efficient and safer driving.

### Research Problem
Despite the abundance of data collected by Waze, there is a significant challenge in effectively analyzing and interpreting this information to draw actionable insights. The primary research problem is to identify factors that influence driver retention and driving behavior using Waze's extensive dataset. Understanding these factors can help improve user engagement and provide a better user experience. This analysis is crucial for developing strategies to enhance user retention and optimize the navigation services provided by Waze.

### Objectives
1. **Analyze User Retention:** Identify key factors influencing user retention and understand the driving patterns of retained vs. non-retained users.
2. **Driving Behavior Analysis:** Examine the driving behaviors, such as the number of drives, total kilometers driven, and duration of drives, to identify trends and insights.
3. **Device Usage Patterns:** Compare the driving patterns and retention rates between Android and iPhone users to uncover any significant differences.

### Hypothesis
1. **User Retention Factors:** Users with higher engagement, measured by the number of sessions and drives, are more likely to be retained.
2. **Device Impact:** There are significant differences in driving behaviors and retention rates between Android and iPhone users.

## Methodology, Results, and Discussion

### Data Description

| ID                          | Unique identifier for each user                          |
| label                       | Retention status of the user (retained or churned)       |
| sessions                    | Number of sessions the user had                          |
| drives                      | Number of drives the user completed                      |
| total_sessions              | Total number of sessions recorded                        |
| n_days_after_onboarding     | Number of days since the user onboarded                  |
| total_navigations_fav1      | Total navigations to the first favorite location         |
| total_navigations_fav2      | Total navigations to the second favorite location        |
| driven_km_drives            | Total kilometers driven during drives                    |
| duration_minutes_drives     | Total duration of drives in minutes                      |
| activity_days               | Number of days the user was active                       |
| driving_days                | Number of days the user drove                            |
| device                      | Type of device used (Android or iPhone)                  |

- **Source of data:** The data is collected from the Waze navigation app.
- **Period collected:** The specific period of data collection is not provided but should cover multiple months to ensure adequate variability.
- **How it was collected:** Data is collected through user interactions with the Waze app, including driving behaviors and session activities.
- **Under what conditions was it collected:** The data was collected under normal usage conditions where users engaged with the Waze app for navigation purposes.

### Exploratory Data Analytics
#### Descriptive Analytics
- Summary statistics of user engagement and driving behavior variables.
- Distribution of sessions, drives, and kilometers driven among users.
- Retention rate comparison between Android and iPhone users.

#### Diagnostics Analytics
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between different variables.
- Identification of patterns and trends in user engagement and driving behavior.

### Data Cleaning/Pre-treatment for Machine Learning
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Normalizing or scaling the data as required.
- Encoding categorical variables like the 'device' type.

### Predictive Data Analytics
- Implementing machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict user retention.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Extracting important features influencing user retention and driving behavior.

## Conclusion
The analysis of Waze data provides significant insights into user retention and driving behaviors. By identifying key factors that influence retention and comparing behaviors across different devices, we can make informed recommendations to enhance user experience and engagement. Implementing predictive models further allows us to foresee user retention patterns, enabling proactive strategies to maintain and grow the user base. This study not only helps in improving the Waze app but also contributes to the broader field of smart transportation systems.
